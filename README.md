# Redefining Development Effort with AI Agents

## Introduction  
AI agents are beginning to reshape how organizations plan, develop, and test software. Rather than replacing humans, the emerging model positions **humans as gatekeepers** who define business intent, review quality, and approve changes, while **AI agents act as developers** that generate stories, code, and tests at scale. This dual model blends accountability with automation, creating a development flow that is both fast and governed.

## Operational Model: Humans as Gatekeepers, AI as Developers

### **Role of Humans (Gatekeepers)**  
- **Business Analysts (BAs):** Provide well-defined requirements and validate AI-generated Jira stories for completeness and correctness.  
- **Tech Leads/Architects:** Act as reviewers of AI-generated code and tests before merge.  
- **QA Leads:** Validate that test cases align with business acceptance criteria and regulatory requirements.  
- **Product Owners:** Approve release readiness after AI agents have delivered and validated working code.  

### **Role of AI Agents (Developers)**  
- **Jira Agent:** Breaks down BA requirements into granular epics/stories with acceptance criteria and test validations.  
- **Developer Agents:** Create GitHub branches, generate code, and push commits.  
- **Unit Testing Agent:** Auto-generates test suites aligned with acceptance criteria.  
- **CI/CD Agent:** Runs builds, executes test cases, enforces quality gates, and produces reports.  

This ensures **humans set intent and enforce governance**, while **AI agents handle repeatable, scalable development work**.

## Jira Story Format for AI-First Development

For AI agents to deliver reliable code, **stories must be machine-consumable** while still readable by humans. A standardized Jira format ensures this:  

### **Jira Story Template**  

**Story Title:**  
_As a [role], I want [functionality], so that [business value]._  

**Description:**  
- **Business Context:** Why this feature is needed.  
- **Functional Requirements:** Clear bullet points with no ambiguity.  
- **Non-Functional Requirements:** Performance, security, scalability expectations.  

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin / BDD Style):**  


**Test Validation Requirements:**  
- Unit tests must cover at least 80% of new code.  
- Include edge cases such as [list of specific scenarios].  
- Negative test cases to validate system resilience.  
- Automated test output should link back to acceptance criteria IDs.  

**Granularity of Requirements:**  
- Each story must be **atomic** (deliverable within a sprint or less).  
- Large requirements are split into multiple stories.  
- Dependencies between stories are explicitly defined.  

**Example Jira Story:**  

- **Title:** _As a customer, I want to reset my password so that I can regain access to my account._  
- **Description:** Password reset should be available via email verification.  
- **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  - **Given** a registered user with a valid email,  
    **When** they request a password reset,  
    **Then** an email with a reset link should be sent.  
  - **Given** an expired reset link,  
    **When** the user clicks on it,  
    **Then** the system should reject it with an appropriate error message.  
- **Test Validation:**  
  - Unit tests for link generation, email delivery, and token expiration.  
  - Negative test: Invalid email request should not trigger an email.  
  - Performance: Reset email should be sent within 5 seconds in 95% of cases.
